**Project Overview:**
I was involved in the carriers route optimization microservice of a project that integrated multiple vendors and carriers and was successfully integrated to create [Open Route Service API](https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/api-docs/optimization/post). routes of multiple carriers with time window and capacity constraints.

I've been interested in constraint issues ever since, and have [a side project](/projects/project-4) to create duty lists for doctors with unavailable day constraint.
