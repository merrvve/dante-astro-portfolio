## Introduction

I am a self-taught developer who started in software by making static web pages during my middle school and high school years. I was playing with _C++_ in those years and managed to develop a simple software and a simple snake game that scanned University programs and matched them with some filters. My interest in computers has continued since then. I have been a _Linux (Ubuntu)_ user for many years. I studied medicine at university and worked as a family physician for a while. I then started working in the field of genetics and took classes in _Python, data analysis, and basic machine learning,_ as well as courses in _genomic data analysis._ I also have [an article](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.14.507921v1) on _RNA-seq data analysis_ with the _R language_. As a freelancer, I occasionally did _data analysis and web scraping with Python_. In the meantime, I continued to create simple websites for my friends and family when necessary.

I started developing web applications with _.NET Core, Angular Framework, Django and Flask_ 2 years ago and I work as a full stack developer on many projects, creating and maintaining applications with a moderate number of users.

## Skills and Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, Typescript
- **Frontend:** Angular (v15-17), TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, PrimeNG, Flowbite, DaisyUI
- **Backend:** Django, Django-Ninja, DRF, Flask
- **DB:** SQLite, MongoDB
- **Others:** Firebase, Git, Nginx, Gunicorn, CentOS, OpenAI API, Langchain, Pandas, Numpy

### Angular Framework

I mostly try to improve myself on Angular Framework. The features I have been using as follows:
- Services, Dependency Injection
- RxJS, Observables, Promises
- Routing, Lazy Loading
- Standalone components
- Custom Attribute Directives

I'am trying to improve myself on subjects like:
- Best Practices
- Testing
- Linting
- Dockerizing Angular apps
- SSR and SSG

### Future Direction as a Frontend Developer

I want to specialize in front-end development by improving my code style with best practices and SOLID principles. I am also ready to use _Next.js_ and _Astro.js_ frameworks in my next projects.
